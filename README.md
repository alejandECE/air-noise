Here are some of the python scripts and ipython jupyter notebooks using TF2.0 I have created to test old and new things related to the
automatic aircraft type recognition from the sound generated during take-off (PHD Thesis). This is not a complete repository
having everything that has been done and does not include the dataset either. I mainly use this material for teaching purposes now.

You can refer to some related papers here:

The .py files are utilities files and the notebooks show the results and application of the models/tools. In all the models implemented I tried to use the tf.data API to build efficient data pipelines.

I can provide the datasets used by request.

Here are some of the python scripts and ipython jupyter notebooks I have created to test old and new things related to the
automatic aircraft type recognition from the sound generated during take-off (PHD Thesis). This is not a complete repository
having everything that has been done and does not include the dataset either. I mainly use this material for teaching purposes now.
